## Pickle
As a data scientist, you will use sets of data in the form of dictionaries, DataFrames, or any other data type. When working with those, you might want to save them to a file, so you can use them later on or send them to someone else. This is what Python's pickle module is for: it serializes objects so they can be saved to a file, and loaded in a program again later on.

The Pickle file is .pkl
